# VIVID - Virtual Environment for Visual Deep Learning

VIVID (VIrtual environment for VIsual Deep learning) is a photo-realistic simulator that aims to facilitate deep learning for computer vision. 
VIVID supports four different characters: robot (mannequin), simple drone, AirSim drone and automobile. Twelve large, diversified indoor and outdoor scenes are included. 
In addition, we create NPC with simulated human actions to simulate real world events, such as gun shooting and forest fire rescue. VIVID is based on [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com) and [Microsoft AirSim](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim).
